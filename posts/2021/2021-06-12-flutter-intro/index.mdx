This article is an Introduction to **Declarative** style of UI design using **<LinkExternal _href="https://www.flutter.dev">Flutter</LinkExternal>** which is now being used by many companies
to create cross platform applications with near native performance using just a single code base.

**<LinkExternal _href="https://www.flutter.dev">Flutter</LinkExternal>** is a *Open-Source* & *Multiplatform* 
UI tookit introduced by Google in 2017. Flutter uses **<LinkExternal _href="https://www.dart.dev">Dart</LinkExternal>** which is a scrpting
language optimised for UI development and null safety. 


# Imperative Model

This has been the norm for developing UI applications for a while now. Frameworks like Android and iOS use the imperative model for UI programming.

> In the imperative model UI is created using manually constructed UI entities like an `Activity` or `Fragment` in Android or a `UIView` in iOS that can later be mutated using methods and setters when the UI changes.

Hence to change a UI element a reference to it must be stored or retreived from the View's parent and any changes shall be done by calling appropirate methods on that object. Pretty straightforward, right ? 

**Naah, not really**. The main issue with this paradigm is that you need to store a reference to
each and every element that the user interacts with or that the element will change in the future when the application state changes. 
And not only that the developer has handle each and every possible application state and all the elements 
need to be updated in the right order.

# Declarative Model

The problem with the imperative model leads us to the declarative model. 

> In the declarative model the developer has to declare the current application UI state and the framework handles the operations to transition to the new state.

This abstraction of the underlying mechanism can be leveraged to effectively create cross-platform applications.

**<LinkExternal _href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</LinkExternal>** and 
**<LinkExternal _href="https://www.flutter.dev">Flutter</LinkExternal>** are two prime examples.

**Consider that you have to repair your car :**

- The Declarative model is analogous to calling your friend ( *framework* ) to fix up your car.

- The Imperative model is like calling up your dad and he gives your *step by step instructions* to fix your car.

Done with the intro let's look at some code.

# An Investigation

For comparison we'll build a simple Android app with a button that changes colour when clicked.

Android uses the the imperative model for porgramming its applications. View layouts are defined in XML files that is inflated into 
view using Kotlin / Java code and later can be manipulated by referencing their object using Ids and calling appropriate methods
on it.

## Using Android SDK

First we define the layout for the app. 

```xml
<!-- activity_main.xml -->

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <Button
        style="@style/Widget.MaterialComponents.Button"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:padding="20dp"
        android:id="@+id/Example_Button"
        android:text="Click me!!"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```
The above code defines the button with `id = Example_Button` placed at the center of the screen. Now we need to inflate this layout
into view in the `MainActivity` class and get the Button object using the id.

```kotlin
// MainActivity.kt

package com.example.examplebutton

import android.annotation.SuppressLint
import android.graphics.Color
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import android.widget.Button

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var exampleButton: Button  // 1
    private var toggleColor = false             // 2
    @SuppressLint("ResourceType")
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {  // 3
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)              // 4 
        exampleButton = findViewById(R.id.Example_Button)   // 5

        exampleButton.setOnClickListener {                  // 6
            toggleColor = when (toggleColor) {
                true -> {
                    it.setBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(resources.getString(R.color.nord)))
                    false
                }
                else -> {
                    it.setBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(resources.getString(R.color.red)))
                    true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You don't really need to understand the code completely but there are some key point:
1. Private variable `exampleButton` will hold the reference to the button and can initialised once the *View* is created.

2. Will store the state of the button, there are better ways to do this using <LinkExternal _href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel"> View Models </LinkExternal> but this will do for now.

3. `onCreate(Bundle?)` is called when the *View* object is created.
4. Now you inflate the previously defined layout into view.
5. Once the layout is inflated into view the reference to the button can be found and stored.
6. Set a listener on the button that is called when the button is clicked by the user.

**NOTE :**

The above implementation has a **subtle bug** and it is related to the way we are storing the application state( *See point 2* ). If are running the code
on your machine just toggle the button color and rotate your device.

## Using Flutter SDK

Now, let's see how Flutter will handle this.

```dart
// main.dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() async {                                     // 1
  runApp(                                               // 2
    MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      home: Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
              title: Text("ExampleButtonFlutter"),
              backgroundColor: Color(0xFF2E3440)
          ),
        body: ExampleButton(),                          // 3
      ),
    ),
  );
}

class ExampleButton extends StatefulWidget {                    // 4
  @override
  _ExampleButtonState createState() => _ExampleButtonState();
}

class _ExampleButtonState extends State<ExampleButton> {        // 5
  var toggled = false;
  final nordColor = const Color(0xFF2E3440);
  final red = const Color(0xFFBF616A);

  void _handleColorChange() {                                   // 6
    setState(() {
        toggled = !toggled;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {                          // 7
    return Center(
      child: TextButton (
          style: TextButton.styleFrom(
              primary: Colors.white,
              backgroundColor: toggled ? red : nordColor,
              padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10, horizontal: 20),
              ),
          onPressed: _handleColorChange,
          child: Text("Click Me")
      )
    );
  }
}
```
Again you don't need to understand the code completely, some key points:

1. `main()` is the starting point for our application and similar to main() functions in other programming
languages like *C++*.

2. `runApp()` is function that will run our Flutter application. Here it is called with a `MaterialApp()` object for creating an application using *Google's Material Design*.

3. In the `body` atttibute we are passing the `ExampleButton` component or as Flutter calls it a `Widget`.

4. Now we define `ExampleButton` widget and it extends the `StatefulWidget` *ie* the widget keeps track of it state and will be updated when its state changes. The class creates a `_ExampleButtonState` state object that would keep track of the widget's state.

5. `_ExampleButtonState` class extends the `State` class and changes to class's object would trigger redrawing
of the `ExampleButton` widget.

6. `_handleColorChange()` is the private callback function that is called when the button is pressed. `setState()` is used to update the state and invalidate the widget which in turn triggers the redrawing.

7. The `build` functions is necessary for every widget. It returns a Widget object defining how the component
is to be shown. The background colour for the button is updated based on the current state.

**NOTE :**

- *Flutter* treats everything as a `Widget` even margin and padding. A widget may be `StatefulWidget` *ie*
the widget maintains an internal state and can be updated or a `StatelessWidget` *ie* an immutable widget
(all variable in the object need to be final).

- Any changes to a state must be notified to the framework (`setState`) and this leads to the rebuild or redrawing of the widget.

# Conclusion

As the number of UI elements in the application grows `MainActivity` class or any UI class in the *Android SDK's Imperative Model* will become more complex as 
you'd need to handle every UI element each with it own activity listeners and with every interaction the UI would have to be 
updated in the right order.

Whereas in the *Flutter SDK* all we had to do was maintain the `toggled` state of the button and any changes to that state would lead 
to the rebuilding of the widget. Another advantage of the *Flutter* application is that it can be built for the Web, Android, iOS, Windows,
macOS and even Linux. 

This abstraction provided by the framework can enable you to build, test and deliver applications and new features faster. This also ensures a uniform experience for all users irrespective of their platform of choice.

The simplicity of the declarative model has been a major shift in how applications are created today. Frameworks like  Microsoft's<LinkExternal _href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">  .NET </LinkExternal> 
and <LinkExternal _href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt</LinkExternal> have introduced features to support a declarative paradigm.

The control provided by the Imperative model may be necessary in case you want something really specific like an intricate animation or a low level platform specific API. 
Both **<LinkExternal _href="https://www.flutter.dev">Flutter</LinkExternal>** and **<LinkExternal _href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</LinkExternal>** have support for calling platform-specific code making a major part of your application code **reuseable**.
